GoGoGeocode is intended to be a very simple java package for geocoding an address to coordinates. The goal is to do minimal work to get the minimal information.

It makes use of the Google Geocoding API (V3). More information on this API can be found at: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/. 
- There is no API key necessary for this version of the web service. 
- The API is subject to a query limit of 2,500 geolocation requests per day. Any additional queries over this limit will yield a status code of "OVER_QUERY_LIMIT"

This class will return coordinates of -1,-1 for any unsuccessful geocoding attempt. Coordinates are returned in string form as "longitude,latitude".

The license is found in the LICENSE file - MIT License.
